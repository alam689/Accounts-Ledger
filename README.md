# ðŸ§¾  Purchase Accounting Logic (VAT-Inclusive with TDS Deduction)

This section outlines how to account for a supplier purchase when the total amount includes VAT and TDS is applicable.

## ðŸ’¡ Scenario:

- **Total Purchase Amount**: BDT 1,000 (VAT inclusive)  
- **VAT Rate**: 15%  
- **TDS Rate**: 5% (on the net amount excluding VAT)

---

## ðŸ“Š Calculation Breakdown:

1. **Net Purchase Amount (Excluding VAT)**  
   ```
   Net Amount = 1000 / 1.15 = 869.57
   ```

2. **VAT Component**  
   ```
   VAT = 1000 - 869.57 = 130.43
   ```

3. **TDS Deduction (5% on Net Amount)**  
   ```
   TDS = 5% Ãƒâ€” 869.57 = 43.48
   ```

4. **Amount Payable to Supplier**  
   ```
   Payable = 1000 - 43.48 = 956.52
   ```
